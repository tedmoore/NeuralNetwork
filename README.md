# NeuralNetwork
Simple multi-layer perceptron in SuperCollider (client side only)

Depending on the context, I usually will use FluCoMa's [MLP objects](https://learn.flucoma.org/learn/mlp-parameters/) instead of this class because the FluCoMa objects train and predict on the server (so much faster).
